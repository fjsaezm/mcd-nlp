      "\tReview: Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car. Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car! \n",

      "\tReview: I feel the Days Inn Tempe is best described as \"a place where you can purchase the right to sleep for awhile.\" I booked my 10-night stay on Travelocity for a non-smoking room, yet when I entered the room I almost choked. It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby. The dollar store had a corkscrew. \n",

Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning. It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.Do yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary. It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had. I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it. It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious. It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete. It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.Anyway, I can't wait to go back! \n",

      "\tReview: I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues. \n",
