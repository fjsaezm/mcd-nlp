      "\tReview: My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb. Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one. The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone. The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour. The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen. I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun. Cheers. \n",

I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it. It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious. It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete. It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.Anyway, I can't wait to go back! \n",

They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.In any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!We had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues. \n",

It was disgusting. I've never had a smoking hotel room before and I will make sure I don't again. They said they couldn't move us to a different room.My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.I'm awarding one star in addition to the minimum one-star rating because I got to drink cheap beer by the pool in 90 degree weather for 10 days, and there are a few good places to eat and two dollar stores very nearby.

      "Review text:  My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb. Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one. The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone. The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour. The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen. I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time. Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun. Cheers. \n",
