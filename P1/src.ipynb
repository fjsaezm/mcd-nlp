Not much around the area, and unless you're familiar with downtown, I would rather have a guest stay in Old Town Scottsdale, etc. BUT if you do stay here, it's awesome. Great boutique rooms. Awesome pool that's happening in the summer. A GREAT rooftop patio bar, and a very very busy lobby with Gallo Blanco attached. A great place to stay, but have a car!\", 'overall': 4.0}\n",

The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure. Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.

I\\'m pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it. It was amazing.While EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious. It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.
