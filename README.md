In this subject, only an extense assignment (found in the folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-nlp/tree/main/P1) was done. This assigment, done in `Python`, had the following steps:

1. Text **loading** and **preprocessing**
2. **POS Tagging** (Part of speech tagging) and **word polarity** tagging for **Sentiment Analysis**
3. **Grammar** definition
4. **Opinion mining** using the previous steps

Also, a presentation about a specific topic was made by each of the members of the group (@Ocete and me). The presentations can be found in the folder [presentations](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-nlp/tree/main/presentations)
